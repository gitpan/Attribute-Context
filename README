Attribute-Context version 0.03
==============================

Attributes that handle subroutine return values based upon context.

For example, instead of having this at the end of a sub:

 sub foo {
     # do stuff
     return wantarray
        ? @results
        : defined wantarray
            ? \@results
            : die "Don't call me in void context!";
 }

You can now do:

 sub foo : Arrayref(NOVOID) {
     # do stuff
     return @results;
 }

See POD and tests for full details.
